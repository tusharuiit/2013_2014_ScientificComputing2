# 2013_2014_ScientificComputing2

I solved assignments in Matlab programming language in the below-mentioned areas.

- typical tasks in the simulation pipeline in scientific computing;
- classification of mathematical models (discrete/continuous, deterministic/stochastic, etc.);
- modelling with (systems) of ordinary differential equations (example: population models);
- modelling with partial differential equations (example: heat equations);
- numerical treatment of models (discretisation of ordinary and partial
differential equations: introduction to Finite Volume and Finite Element
